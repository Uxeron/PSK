# PSK
University project for the PSK lecture

## Frontend
Made with [React](https://reactjs.org/ "React's Homepage") using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/ "Typescript's Homepage"). For handling CSS we are using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/ "Tailwinds's Homepage") and as a basis for its UI components - [MerakiUI](https://merakiui.com/ "MerakiUI's Homepage"). _(More information will be added as the development progresses)_

To start the application locally, run `npm install` and `npm start`. (Make sure you have [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed on your machine)

FE was created using `create-react-app --template typescript`.
